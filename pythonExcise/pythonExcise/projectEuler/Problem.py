***Lattice paths***
Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, 
there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

Answer: 


'''

import time
start_time = time.time()

print ("\n************* Solution 1 starts ************\n")

        
print ("\n************* Solution 1 ends ************\n")

elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
print(time.strftime("%H:%M:%S", time.gmtime(elapsed_time)))
